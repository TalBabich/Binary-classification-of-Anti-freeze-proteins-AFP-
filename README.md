# Binary-classification-of-Anti-freeze-proteins-AFP-
This project was a Kaggle competition - The final project of the intro2ds class for 2021.

Overview and features

The goal is to classify between antifreeze proteins (AFP) and non-antifreeze ones. For each protein, there are 1741 features. 

After several attempts I chose to build a model that would be based on the XGB algorithm because it gave me the best results for the given problem.
